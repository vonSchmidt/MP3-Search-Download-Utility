#Console Based MP3 Search/Download Utility

##Usage:

When launched, the utility prompts the user for search terms, and will use
[mp3zap](http://mp3zap.com) to fetch results based on the inputted query.

Results are stored and the utility awaits for an integer which represents the
number of the chosen track.

Track will finally be downloaded (HTTP Response Content) to
`/path/of/the/script/mp3/`.
